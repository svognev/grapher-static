These are only part of the trade limitation factors, especially when \nlooking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential \ntreatment that set criteria for eligibility. \n \nA full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries are used for the computation, but \npreferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries' exporters for different reasons \nsuch as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin). As \nthere is no accurate statistical information on the extent of the actual utilisation of each of these \npreferences, it is assumed that they are fully utilised. \n \nDuty free treatment is an indicator of market access, but is not always synonymous with preferential \ntreatment for beneficiary countries, because a number of MFN tariffs are already at, or close to, zero, \nespecially for fuels and minerals. International agreements on IT products also offer duty-free treatment \nfor components and equipment used for production purpose\" \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \nAsia and Pacific: 42 \nAfrica: 49 \nLatin America and the Caribbean: 34 \nEurope, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 48 \n \nTime series: \n \nYearly data from 2005 to latest year  \n \n"}}}}
