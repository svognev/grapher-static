In some studies and reports, education is included in social spending. This is not the case in this dataset.\n\nHandling of underlying sources\n\nThis dataset was constructed by combining three sources. These are the OECD Social Expenditure Database (OECD SOCX), OECD (1985) and Lindert (2004).\n\nThese three sources were combined as follows. For the period 1980-2016 we report the figures as published in OECD SOCX. For the period 1960-1979, we extended the recent figures (from OECD SOCX) backwards by using the rates of change as reported in OECD (1985). And for the period 1880-1930, we took observations from Lindert (2004).\n\nTo be precise, the data for the period 1960-1979 was obtained by relying on the earliest available observation from OECD SOCX, and then successively extending the series backwards by using the year-by-year rate of change implied by the estimates in OECD (1985). Here is an example:\n\nOECD_SOCX_(Year-1) = [OECD_SOCX_(Year)] x [OECD_1985_(year-1)]/[ OECD_1985_(year)]\n\nBackward extrapolation for the period 1960-1979 was necessary because the levels in the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) do not exactly coincide for the overlapping years. The implicit assumption, then, is that the estimates from OECD SOCX and OECD (1985) have different levels, but common trends.\n\nIn this visualization (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/various-measures-of-social-expenditure-as-share-of-gdp?country=AUS) you can see how the various underlying sources compare to our constructed series.\n\nFurther remarks\n\nAccording to the Manual to the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX), the OECD defines social expenditure as “The provision by public and private institutions of benefits to, and financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during circumstances which adversely affect their welfare, provided that the provision of the benefits and financial contributions constitutes neither a direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract or transfer”\n\nThe series on Social expenditure for France and Denmark in OECD(1985) are not complete. However, Lindert (2004) uses the data available to estimate social expenditure in 1960 and 1970. Therefore, we use his estimations to extrapolate backwards for those two points in time.\n\nIn OECD (1985) social expenditure figures include expenditure on education. To ensure consistency with Lindert (2004) and OECD (SOCX), we subtracted education."}},"1838":{"id":1838,"name":"Social Expenditure %GDP - OECD (1985)","unit":"%","description":"Social expenditure is defined here as the sum of the public expenditures on health, pensions, unemployment compensation and other social policies as percentage of GDP.","created_at":"2017-05-17T07:31:57.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:29.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-05-17T11:30:44.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","fk_dst_id":448,"fk_var_type_id":3,"sourceId":596,"uploaded_by":"marco","display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"Social Expenditure in the long run - Lindert 2004; OECD 1985; OECD (SOCX).","s_id":596,"s_name":"OECD (1985)","source":{"id":596,"name":"OECD (1985)","dataPublishedBy":"OECD (1985), \"Social Expenditure 1960-1990: problems of growth and control\", OECD social policy studies\"","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"http://www.worldcat.org/title/social-expenditure-1960-1990-problems-of-growth-and-control/oclc/568030375&referer=brief_results","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"In OECD (1985), Total Social Expenditure is defined as the sum of the expenditures in the following social policy areas:\n\n- Education (spending on pre-primary, primary, secondary, tertiary, education affairs and services and subsidiary services to education).\n\n- Health (spending on hospitals, clinics and medical, dental and para-medical practitioners, public health, medicament, prostheses, medical equipment and appliances or other prescribed health-related products, and applied research and experimental development related to health and medical delivery systems).\n\n- Pensions (spending on old-age, disability or survivors' benefits, other than for government employees, and government employee pensions).\n\n- Unemployment compensation (spending on social insurance and other government schemes to individuals to compensate for loss of income due to unemployment).\n\n- Other social expenditure (spending on sickness, maternity or temporary disablement benefits, family and child allowances, other social assistance and welfare affairs and services)."}},"1839":{"id":1839,"name":"Social Expenditure %GDP - OECD (SOCX)","unit":"%","description":"Social expenditure is defined here as the sum of the public expenditures on the following social policy areas as percentage of GDP: Old age, Survivors, Incapacity-related benefits, health, family, active labor market programmes, unemployment, housing, and other social policy areas.","created_at":"2017-05-17T08:17:06.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:29.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-05-17T08:17:06.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","fk_dst_id":448,"fk_var_type_id":3,"sourceId":595,"uploaded_by":"marco","display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"Social Expenditure in the long run - Lindert 2004; OECD 1985; OECD (SOCX).","s_id":595,"s_name":"OECD (SOCX)","source":{"id":595,"name":"OECD (SOCX)","dataPublishedBy":"OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX)","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?datasetcode=SOCX_AGG","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"In OECD (SOCX) the main social policy areas that form Social Expenditure are as follows: Old age, Survivors, Incapacity-related benefits, Health, Family, Active labor market programmes, Unemployment, Housing, and Other social policy areas.

He defines total social expenditure as social transfers plus public expenditure on education. However, the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX) does not include expenditure on education.\n\nAccording to Lindert (2004), total social transfers correspond to basic assistance to poor families [alias “poor relief” (before 1930), “family assistance,” “welfare” (in America), or “supplemental income”], unemployment compensation, (alias “the dole”), public non-contributory pensions (in which the funds come from persons other than the recipient and his or her employer), public health expenditures, and housing subsidies."}}}}
