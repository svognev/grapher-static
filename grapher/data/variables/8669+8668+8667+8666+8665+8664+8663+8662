The same applies to other forms of energy such as incinerated waste products;\r\n\r\n2. this work considers as primary electricity the following sources: geothermal (only for electricity); hydropower, nuclear power, wind, photo­voltaics, tidals, wave and solar thermal (only for electricity). Generally electricity that has been derived from firewood, wastes, or other biomass is not included in ‘primary electricity’ as this entails thermal losses;\r\n\r\n3. non-energy uses of oil and natural gas are excluded from the totals.\r\n\r\nOriginal references:\r\n\r\nItaly: Malanima, Paolo, Energy consumption in Italy, 1861-2000, CNR (2006) in Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nPortugal: Henriques, S, Energy Transitions, Economic Growth and Structural Change: Portugal in a Long-run Comparative Perspective, Lund Studies in Economic History (2011).\r\n\r\nSpain: Elaborated by Mar Rubio for Kander, Astrid; Gales, Ben; Rubio, Mar; Paolo Malanima, \"North versus South: Energy transition and energy intensity in Europe over 200 years\", European Review of Economic History 11/2, (2007).\r\n\r\nFrance:Elaborated by Ben Gales, Paolo Malanima and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nGermany: Elaborated by Ben Gales and Paul Warde for Kander et al, Power to the People (Princeton, 2013).\r\n\r\nSweden: Kander, Astrid, Economic growth, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Sweden, Lund Studies in Economic History, 2002, with further elaborations until 2008 from Swedish National Statistics.\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales:Updated from Warde, Paul, Energy Consumption in England & Wales, 1560-2004 (Naples: CNR, 2007).\r\n\r\nCanada: Richard W.
