All data represents global figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nThe original sources of absolute data from which these indexes were derived are as follows:\n\nPopulation: Data represents the total population (both sexes, all ages). Data sourced from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nUrban population: measures the absolute number of people living in urban areas. Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI). Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nGDP: measures total gross domestic product in constant 2010 US$ (adjusted for inflation). Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI). Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nCereal yield: based on the World Bank's World Development Indicator (WDI) variable, \"Cereal yield (hectares)\". Available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\n\nAgricultural area: represents total agricultural area which is the combination of arable land, permanent crops and pasture/grazing land. Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL\n\nCropland: represents arable land area. Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/RL\n\nCaloric supply: represents the caloric supply available for food consumption. Derived by multiplying the UN FAO's variable \"Food supply quantity (kcal/capita/day) by global population figures, as published by the UN Population Division. Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS\n\nMeat production: measures total meat production (all types). Data published by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Available at: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS\n\nFreshwater use: represents annual freshwater withdrawals for agriculture, industry and municipal uses. Data published by the Global International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGB). Available at: \thttp://www.igbp.net/globalchange/greatacceleration.4.1b8ae20512db692f2a680001630.html\n\nCO₂ emissions: measures carbon dioxide emissions from energy and manufacturing output. Data published by the World Bank's World Development Indicators.

All data represents global figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nThe original sources of absolute data from which these indexes were derived are as follows:\n\nPopulation: Data represents the total population (both sexes, all ages). Data sourced from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nUrban population: measures the absolute number of people living in urban areas. Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).

All data represents global figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nThe original sources of absolute data from which these indexes were derived are as follows:\n\nPopulation: Data represents the total population (both sexes, all ages). Data sourced from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nUrban population: measures the absolute number of people living in urban areas. Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).

All data represents global figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nThe original sources of absolute data from which these indexes were derived are as follows:\n\nPopulation: Data represents the total population (both sexes, all ages). Data sourced from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nUrban population: measures the absolute number of people living in urban areas. Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).

All data represents global figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nThe original sources of absolute data from which these indexes were derived are as follows:\n\nPopulation: Data represents the total population (both sexes, all ages). Data sourced from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nUrban population: measures the absolute number of people living in urban areas. Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).

All data represents global figures, and is based on an index where absolute values in 1965 are equal to 100 (1965 = 100). For example, this means a figure of 200 in 1995 would represent a doubling of a given variable between 1965-1995.\n\nThe original sources of absolute data from which these indexes were derived are as follows:\n\nPopulation: Data represents the total population (both sexes, all ages). Data sourced from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017). World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision, DVD Edition. Available at: https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\n\nUrban population: measures the absolute number of people living in urban areas. Data published in the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI).
