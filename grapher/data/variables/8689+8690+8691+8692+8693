Our dataset updates their data through to 2017 using Inter-parliamentary union (IPU) statistical archives and the World Bank’s World Development Indicator (WDI) variable on women’s share in parliament (main sources).\n\nPaxton’s data is downloaded from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). It provides country-level data on the start and end year of sovereignty; year in which universal suffrage was granted to all women; the year the first woman was elected to parliament; and percentage share of women in parliament for the years 1945-2003. Data from 2003 onwards was derived from various sources. IPU’s statistical archives were used to derive figures on the share of women in parliament (from 2004-2017); the CIA World Factbook provided data on the year of sovereignty and universal suffrage, alongside various additional sources which are listed below. Moreover, this data extension to 2017 means our dataset consists of five additional countries: Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan and Timor, which gained independence after 2003. Paxton et al (2006) describes women’s political representation as the share of sovereign countries which satisfied the five representation milestones in any given year. We have therefore derived the number of sovereign countries generated in any given year, as well as the number which have attained each of the five milestones.\n\nTo overcome methodological differences, the attainment of milestones was assessed in two ways. Firstly, the number and share of sovereign countries were assessed relative to ‘ordered’ milestones. This results from Paxton et al’s (2006) assumption that a country only has an elected woman MP after universal suffrage is granted. However, there were 17 countries - Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, South Africa, USSR, United Kingdom, and the United States – whereby a female MP was elected prior to gaining universal suffrage. Secondly, we assessed the number and share of sovereign countries which independently satisfied five milestones.\n\nAdditional information on data sources: \nThis section provides detailed information on the sources used by variables and countries.\n\nSovereignty \nCIA’s World Factbook Independence field is used to determine the year of sovereignty for Libya, Montenegro, Serbia, South Sudan, Timor, American Samoa, Hungary and Iran. Likewise, we determine end of sovereignty for Libya and Serbia and Montenegro using the same source.
