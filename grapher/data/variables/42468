These include the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (HETUS), OECD Time Use Database, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and diverse national sources for countries not covered in the previous databases.\r\n\r\nDifferent sources use different reference years, as well as different definitions of unpaid care work.
