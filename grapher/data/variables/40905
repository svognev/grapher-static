{"variables":{"40905":{"id":40905,"name":"Percentage of teachers in pre-primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","unit":"%","description":"Number of teachers in a given level of education who are qualified is expressed as a percentage of all teachers in that level of education.  A qualified teacher is one who has the minimum academic qualifications necessary to teach at a specific level of education in a given country. This is usually related to the subject(s) they teach. The percentage of qualified teachers should not exceed 100%. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers should be converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ numbers of teachers; a double-shift teacher should be counted twice, etc. Ideally, all staff involved in direct classroom-teaching roles should be included in the calculations. High values indicate that students are being taught by teachers who are academically well qualified in the subjects they teach.","created_at":"2017-09-10T12:24:06.000Z","updated_at":"2017-09-10T12:24:06.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-09-10T12:24:06.000Z","code":"UIS.QUTP.02","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","fk_dst_id":886,"fk_var_type_id":4,"sourceId":5411,"uploaded_by":null,"displayIsProjection":null,"displayName":null,"displayShortUnit":null,"displayTolerance":null,"displayUnit":null,"displayUnitConversionFactor":null,"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Teachers","s_id":5411,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in pre-primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":5411,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in pre-primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}}}
