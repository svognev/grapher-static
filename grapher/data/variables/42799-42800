(2008) and its sources.\r\nWorld population figures were sourced from Gapminder for the years 1900-1949, and from the UN Population Division from 1950 onwards.\r\nThe share of the world's population reliant on Haber-Bosch fertilizer production for food production was estimated based on Figure 1 in Erisman et al. (2008). These figures are based on approximation, although coincide with several published projections of these estimates. Erisman et al. estimate that by 2000, 44% of the global population were sustained by Haber-Bosch nitrogen, rising to 48% by 2008. This approximately coincides with Smil (2002) estimates of 40% by 2000. OWID have extrapolated these estimates to 2015, assuming that approximately 50% (±2%) rely on Haber-Bosch nitrogen.\r\nErisman, J. W., Sutton, M. A., Galloway, J., Klimont, Z., & Winiwarter, W.
