This was developed by the FAO in 2014 and developed across 140 countries.\n\nThe FEIS measures the percentage of individuals in the population who have experienced food insecurity at moderate or severe levels during the reference period. Data at the individual or household level is collected by applying an experience-based food security scale questionnaire within a survey. The food security survey module collects answers to questions asking respondents to report the occurrence of several typical experiences and conditions associated with food insecurity. \n\nFull information on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) can be found at: http://www.fao.org/3/a-as583e.pdf"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"3":{"name":"France","code":"FRA"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"7":{"name":"Switzerland","code":"CHE"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"14":{"name":"Japan","code":"JPN"},"15":{"name":"Afghanistan","code":"AFG"},"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"36":{"name":"Botswana","code":"BWA"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"40":{"name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BFA"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"85":{"name":"Slovakia","code":"SVK"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"119":{"name":"Lithuania","code":"LTU"},"122":{"name":"Latvia","code":"LVA"},"130":{"name":"Jordan","code":"JOR"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"133":{"name":"Israel","code":"ISR"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"142":{"name":"Myanmar","code":"MMR"},"148":{"name":"Guatemala","code":"GTM"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"156":{"name":"Estonia","code":"EST"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"162":{"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZE"},"165":{"name":"Croatia","code":"HRV"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"171":{"name":"China","code":"CHN"},"172":{"name":"Chile","code":"CHL"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"210":{"name":"Luxembourg","code":"LUX"},"213":{"name":"Mauritius","code":"MUS"},"215":{"name":"Montenegro","code":"MNE"},"233":{"name":"Seychelles","code":"SYC"},"258":{"name":"South Sudan","code":"SSD"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"289":{"name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"295":{"name":"South America","code":null},"302":{"name":"South Asia","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"454":{"name":"Least developed countries","code":null},"462":{"name":"Eastern Africa","code":null},"463":{"name":"Middle Africa","code":null},"464":{"name":"Northern Africa","code":null},"465":{"name":"Southern Africa","code":null},"466":{"name":"Western Africa","code":null},"469":{"name":"Central Asia","code":null},"473":{"name":"Eastern Europe","code":null},"474":{"name":"Northern Europe","code":null},"475":{"name":"Southern Europe","code":null},"476":{"name":"Western Europe","code":null},"477":{"name":"Central America","code":null},"5404":{"name":"Landlocked developing countries","code":null},"34613":{"name":"East Asia","code":null},"34614":{"name":"Southeast Asia","code":null},"35101":{"name":"West Asia","code":null},"36411":{"name":"Europe and North America","code":null},"36412":{"name":"Central and South Asia","code":null},"36413":{"name":"East and Southeast Asia","code":null},"36414":{"name":"North Africa and West Asia","code":null},"36416":{"name":"Australia and New Zealand","code":null}}}
