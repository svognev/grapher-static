Recorded alcohol consumption refers to official statistics (production, import, export, and sales or taxation data), while the unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control. In circumstances in which the number of tourists per year is at least the number of inhabitants, the tourist consumption is also taken into account and is deducted from the country's recorded APC.\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\nAdministrative reporting system\n\nOther possible data sources\n\n    \n\nMethod of measurement\nSee measurement method for the two
