The MICS include a standard set of questions covering different disciplinary methods. It does allow survey respondents to report both violent and nonviolent forms of discipline.\r\n\r\n–The source notes that estimates reported in UNICEF publications and in MICS country reports prior to 2010 were calculated using household weights that did not take into account the last-stage selection of children for the administration of the child discipline module in MICS surveys. (A random selection of one child aged 2–14 is undertaken for the administration of the child discipline module.) In January 2010, it was decided that more accurate estimates are produced by using a household weight that takes the last-stage selection into account. MICS3 data were recalculated using this approach. All estimates produced after 2010 use the revised estimates.\r\n\r\n– When it was first implemented in MICS3, the child discipline module was administered only to mothers/primary caregivers, who were asked whether any of the disciplinary methods covered in the module had been used by any member of the household during the month preceding the interview. Beginning with MICS4, the methodology was changed: Any adult household member, not just the mother or primary caregiver, can now respond to the questions on child discipline."}}},"entityKey":{"15":{"name":"Afghanistan","code":"AFG"},"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"17":{"name":"Algeria","code":"DZA"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"29":{"name":"Barbados","code":"BRB"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"31":{"name":"Belize","code":"BLZ"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"40":{"name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BFA"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"63":{"name":"Uruguay","code":"URY"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"66":{"name":"Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"73":{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago","code":"TTO"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"77":{"name":"Syria","code":"SYR"},"78":{"name":"Swaziland","code":"SWZ"},"79":{"name":"Sudan","code":"SDN"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"94":{"name":"Guinea-Bissau","code":"GNB"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"110":{"name":"Morocco","code":"MAR"},"111":{"name":"Moldova","code":"MDA"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"114":{"name":"Mauritania","code":"MRT"},"117":{"name":"Malawi","code":"MWI"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"124":{"name":"Lebanon","code":"LBN"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"126":{"name":"Kyrgyzstan","code":"KGZ"},"130":{"name":"Jordan","code":"JOR"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"132":{"name":"Jamaica","code":"JAM"},"134":{"name":"Iraq","code":"IRQ"},"140":{"name":"Palestine","code":"PSE"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"145":{"name":"Haiti","code":"HTI"},"146":{"name":"Guyana","code":"GUY"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"152":{"name":"Georgia","code":"GEO"},"154":{"name":"Djibouti","code":"DJI"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"164":{"name":"Cuba","code":"CUB"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"168":{"name":"Congo","code":"COG"},"173":{"name":"Chad","code":"TCD"},"174":{"name":"Central African Republic","code":"CAF"},"195":{"name":"Solomon Islands","code":"SLB"},"202":{"name":"Fiji","code":"FJI"},"204":{"name":"Kiribati","code":"KIR"},"215":{"name":"Montenegro","code":"MNE"},"221":{"name":"Vanuatu","code":"VUT"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"229":{"name":"Saint Lucia","code":"LCA"},"232":{"name":"Sao Tome and Principe","code":"STP"},"234":{"name":"Suriname","code":"SUR"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"}}}
