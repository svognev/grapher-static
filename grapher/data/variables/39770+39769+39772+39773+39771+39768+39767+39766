Students with scores below Level 1b (less or equal to 262 points) usually do not succeed at the most basic reading tasks that PISA measures. This does not necessarily mean that they are illiterate, but that there is insufficient information on which to base a description of their reading proficiency. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Below Level 1 to Level 5) than later assessments, which use a reading scale from Below Level 1B to Level 6. Because an equivalent proficiency level to \"Below Level 1B\" and Level 1B were not calculated for the 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA Reports, the data are not currently available for those years.

Tasks at level 3 require the reader to locate, and in some cases recognize the relationship between, several pieces of information that must meet multiple conditions. Interpretative tasks at this level require the reader to integrate several parts of a text in order to identify a main idea, understand a relationship or construe the meaning of a word or phrase. They need to take into account many features in comparing, contrasting or categorizing.

Reflective tasks at this level may require connections, comparisons, and explanations, or they may require the reader to evaluate a feature of the text.
