Plant and animal GRFA conserved in these facilities can be easily used in \nbreeding programmes as well, even directly on-farm. \n \nThe measure of trends in ex situ conserved materials provides an overall assessment of the extent to \nwhich we are managing to maintain and/or increase the total genetic diversity available for future use \nand thus protected from any permanent loss of genetic diversity which may occur in the natural habitat, \ni.e. in situ, or on-farm. \n \nThe two components of the indicator, plant and animal GRFA, are separately counted. \n \nPlant genetic resources  \nThe plant component is calculated as the number of accessions of plant genetic resources secured in \nconservation facilities under medium or long term conditions, where an ‘accession’ is defined as a distinct \nsample of seeds, planting materials or plants which is maintained in a genebank. Genebank Standards for \nPlant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (accessible at \nhttp://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/7b79ee93-0f3c-5f58-9adc-5d4ef063f9c7/), set the benchmark \nfor current scientific and technical best practices for conserving plant genetic resources, and support key \ninternational policy instruments for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. These voluntary \nstandards have been endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at \nits Fourteenth Regular Session (http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).  \n \nAnimal genetic resources  \nThe animal component is calculated as the number of local breeds stored within a genebank collection \nwith an amount of genetic material stored which is required to reconstitute the breed (based on the \nGuidelines on Cryconservation of Animal Genetic Resources, FAO, 2012, accessible at \n\n\fhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm). The guidelines have been endorsed by the \nCommission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its Thirteenth Regular Session \n(http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/024/mc192e.pdf). \n \nComments and limitations: \nPlant genetic resources \nBroadly, two issues are of concern in using the “number of accessions” as an indicator of diversity in ex \nsitu collections: \n \nUndetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a \nmanaged unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a \nreduction in the number of accession previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example \nwithin genebank collections and also at international level. \n \nA loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may as well not be reflected \nin the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions. \n \nAdditional information could be provided by other indicators measuring ex situ conservation, which are \npart of the monitoring of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA.  \n \nAnimal genetic resources \nTo collect data on a regular base the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System DAD-IS needs to be \namended. \n \n\n\f\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nPlant genetic resources \nThe most recent data collected for the implementation of the Second Global Plan of Action for PGRFA will \nserve as baseline (number of accessions as of June 2014).  \n \nAs of March 2016, data on about 3.6 million accessions were gathered from 71 countries and 12 \ninternational centres. The data collection is ongoing and expected to be finalized by December 2017. \nEfforts are made to improve the coverage of countries. \n \nAnimal genetic resources \nThe analysis of country reports to FAO provided by 128 countries for the preparation of ‘The Second \nReport on the State of the World’s Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture’ provides a first \nbaseline with regard to the number of national breed populations where sufficient material is stored. \n \n\n                                                           \n1 Accession number: The unique identifier for the accession within the genebank, and is assigned when a \nsample is entered into the genebank collection.  \n\n\fTime series: \nPlant genetic resources \nAccession level information which includes the acquisition date in country reporting also allows to \nroughly estimate the status of the indicators of the plant component in previous years.   \n \nAnimal genetic resources \nBase line of data are country reports provided in 2014. \n \n"}}},"entityKey":{"2":{"name":"Ireland","code":"IRL"},"10":{"name":"Sweden","code":"SWE"},"15":{"name":"Afghanistan","code":"AFG"},"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"33":{"name":"Bhutan","code":"BTN"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"68":{"name":"Uganda","code":"UGA"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"115":{"name":"Mali","code":"MLI"},"119":{"name":"Lithuania","code":"LTU"},"122":{"name":"Latvia","code":"LVA"},"124":{"name":"Lebanon","code":"LBN"},"130":{"name":"Jordan","code":"JOR"},"146":{"name":"Guyana","code":"GUY"},"152":{"name":"Georgia","code":"GEO"},"155":{"name":"Finland","code":"FIN"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"163":{"name":"Cyprus","code":"CYP"},"215":{"name":"Montenegro","code":"MNE"},"464":{"name":"Northern Africa","code":null},"36415":{"name":"Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand)","code":null}}}
