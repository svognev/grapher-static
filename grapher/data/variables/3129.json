Differences exist not only across different household surveys in the same country but also across the same type of survey carried out in different countries, so estimates of working children are not fully comparable across countries. For detailed source information, see footnotes at each data point.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Data are from household surveys by the International Labor Organization (ILO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Bank, and national statistical offices. The surveys yield data on education, employment, health, expenditure, and consumption indicators related to children's work. Since children's work is captured in the sense of \"economic activity,\" the data refer to children in employment, a broader concept than child labor (see ILO 2009a for details on this distinction).\n\nHousehold survey data generally include information on work type - for example, whether a child is working for payment in cash or in kind or is involved in unpaid work, working for someone who is not a member of the household, or involved in any type of family work (on the farm or in a business).\n\nIn line with the definition of economic activity adopted by the 13th International Conference of Labour Statisticians, the threshold set by the 1993 UN System of National Accounts for classifying a person as employed is to have been engaged at least one hour in any activity relating to the production of goods and services during the reference period. Children seeking work are thus excluded. Economic activity covers all market production and certain nonmarket production, including production of goods for own use. It excludes unpaid household services (commonly called \"household chores\") - that is, the production of domestic and personal services by household members for a household's own consumption.\n\nCountry surveys define the ages for child labor as 5-17. The data here have been recalculated to present statistics for children ages 7-14.\n"}}},"entityKey":{"15":{"name":"Afghanistan","code":"AFG"},"16":{"name":"Albania","code":"ALB"},"17":{"name":"Algeria","code":"DZA"},"19":{"name":"Angola","code":"AGO"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"34":{"name":"Bolivia","code":"BOL"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"40":{"name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BFA"},"41":{"name":"Burundi","code":"BDI"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"60":{"name":"Zambia","code":"ZMB"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"62":{"name":"Uzbekistan","code":"UZB"},"63":{"name":"Uruguay","code":"URY"},"64":{"name":"Tanzania","code":"TZA"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"66":{"name":"Macedonia","code":"MKD"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"68":{"name":"Uganda","code":"UGA"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"73":{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago","code":"TTO"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"77":{"name":"Syria","code":"SYR"},"78":{"name":"Swaziland","code":"SWZ"},"79":{"name":"Sudan","code":"SDN"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"82":{"name":"Somalia","code":"SOM"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"91":{"name":"Rwanda","code":"RWA"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"94":{"name":"Guinea-Bissau","code":"GNB"},"95":{"name":"Portugal","code":"PRT"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"98":{"name":"Paraguay","code":"PRY"},"100":{"name":"Panama","code":"PAN"},"101":{"name":"Pakistan","code":"PAK"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"105":{"name":"Nicaragua","code":"NIC"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"108":{"name":"Namibia","code":"NAM"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"110":{"name":"Morocco","code":"MAR"},"111":{"name":"Moldova","code":"MDA"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"114":{"name":"Mauritania","code":"MRT"},"115":{"name":"Mali","code":"MLI"},"117":{"name":"Malawi","code":"MWI"},"118":{"name":"Madagascar","code":"MDG"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"123":{"name":"Lesotho","code":"LSO"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"126":{"name":"Kyrgyzstan","code":"KGZ"},"129":{"name":"Kenya","code":"KEN"},"130":{"name":"Jordan","code":"JOR"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"132":{"name":"Jamaica","code":"JAM"},"134":{"name":"Iraq","code":"IRQ"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"139":{"name":"Honduras","code":"HND"},"141":{"name":"Sri Lanka","code":"LKA"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"145":{"name":"Haiti","code":"HTI"},"147":{"name":"Guinea","code":"GIN"},"148":{"name":"Guatemala","code":"GTM"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"152":{"name":"Georgia","code":"GEO"},"153":{"name":"Gabon","code":"GAB"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"168":{"name":"Congo","code":"COG"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"172":{"name":"Chile","code":"CHL"},"173":{"name":"Chad","code":"TCD"},"174":{"name":"Central African Republic","code":"CAF"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"225":{"name":"Timor","code":"TLS"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"258":{"name":"South Sudan","code":"SSD"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"}}}
