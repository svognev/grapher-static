Because of this, year to year changes should be interpreted with caution. You can read more about literacy measurement here: https://ourworldindata.org/how-is-literacy-measured\n</br>\n- The World Bank's WDI estimates correspond to UNESCO Institute for Statistics. OxLAD estimates come from several underlying sources (see original documentation for more details).\n</br>\n- For Paraguay in 1982, the OxLAD data source was favoured over the World Bank (WDI) as the latter estimates literacy rates at 78.46%, a much lower estimate compared to neighbouring years for which there was data available.\n</br>\n- Sources for each country-year observation can be found in
