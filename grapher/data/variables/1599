For example, consumption group 1.25 - 1.9 is calculated as follows: 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.9 int-$ per day' minus 'total population living under the poverty line at 1.25 int-$ per day'.\nConsumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank’s analysis of global poverty. But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys. For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption.\n\nWarning:\n'Rich' countries are not included in the PovcalNet tables used for these calculations. Therefore, people belonging to these consumption groups, but living in rich countries (defined by the World Bank) are not represented in these figures.\n\n'Non-rich' countries are all countries in the World except: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States."}}}}
