considered a central driver of long-term economic growth and living standards.\nContact person/organisation\nproductivity.contact@oecd.org  The OECD Compendium of Productivity Indicators provides a comprehensive overview of recent and longer term trends in productivity levels and growth in OECD and selected non-OECD countries. The most recent edition of the Compendium, as well as information on the methodologies used in the OECD Productivity Dtabase, are available on the OECD productivity internet page:\nOECD productivity internet page\nhttp://www.oecd.org/std/productivity-stats/\nData source(s) used\nThe indicators presented in this dataset are mainly based on GDP, population and employment statistics from the OECD Annual National Accounts. Hours worked are sourced from the OECD Annual National Accounts, the OECD Employment Outlook and national sources.\nDate last updated\nLast updated: November 2017.The OECD Productivity Database aims at providing users with the most comprehensive and the latest productivity estimates.  The update cycle is on a rolling basis, i.e. each variable in the dataset is made publicly available as soon as it is updated in the sources databases. However, timely data issues may arise and affect individual series and/or countries. In particular, annual hours worked estimates from the OECD Employment Outlook are typically updated less frequently (once a year, in the summer) than series of hours worked from the OECD Annual National Accounts.  The current version of the OECD Productivity Database accounts for the new changes which have recently occurred in the OECD National Accounts.
