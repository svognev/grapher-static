sites for mountain biodiversity shows temporal \ntrends in the mean percentage of each important site for mountain biodiversity (i.e., those that \ncontribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected \nareas. \n \nComments and limitations: \nQuality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the World \nDatabase on Protected Areas. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and \ntranslated into the standard data structure of the World Database on Protected Areas. Discrepancies \nbetween the data in the World Database on Protected Areas and new data are minimised by provision of \na manual (UNEP-WCMC 2016) and resolved in communication with data providers. Similar processes \napply for the incorporation of data into the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas. \n \nThe indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which \nultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A \n\n\fnumber of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have \nbeen developed for assessment of protected area management, which can be synthesised into an \nindicator (Leverington et al. 2010). This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a \ncomplementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11  \n(http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). However, there may be little relationship between these \nmeasures and protected area outcomes (Nolte & Agrawal 2013). More recently, approaches to “green \nlisting” have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes \nof protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied \nmore broadly. \n \nData and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN \ndefinition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. \nMoreover, “other effective area-based conservation measures”, as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target  \n11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal \nprotected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be \nmanaged in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are \nimportant (Jonas et al. 2014). However, standard approaches to documentation of “other effective area-\nbased conservation measures” are still under debate through the IUCN Task Force on Other Effective \nAreas Based Conservation Measures which will conclude with recommendations for a definition on \nOECMs. Once defined it is likely OEMCs will be documented in the World Database on Protected Areas. \n \nRegarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused on specific \nsubsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas) and highly \nthreatened species (for Alliance for Zero Extinction sites). While Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas \nhave been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally (Brooks et al. 2001, Pain et \nal. 2005), the application of the unified standard for identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (IUCN 2016) \nsites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups \nremains a high priority, building from efforts to date (Eken et al. 2004, Knight et al. 2007, Langhammer et \nal. 2007, Foster et al. 2012).  \n \nKey Biodiversity Area identification has been validated for a number of countries and regions where \ncomprehensive biodiversity data allow formal calculation of the site importance (or “irreplaceability”) \nusing systematic conservation planning techniques (Di Marco et al. 2016, Montesino Pouzols et al. 2014). \n \nFuture developments of the indicator will include: a) expansion of the taxonomic coverage of mountain \nKey Biodiversity Areas through application of the Key Biodiversity Areas standard (IUCN 2016) to a wide \nvariety of mountain vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and ecosystem type; b) improvements in the data \non protected areas by continuing to increase the proportion of sites with documented dates of \ndesignation and with digitised boundary polygons (rather than coordinates); and c) exploring other \nmethods for assessing and presenting temporal trends in protected area coverage. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fThis indicator has been classified by the IAEG-SDGs as Tier 1. Current data are available for all countries in \nthe world, and these are updated on an ongoing basis. \n \nTime series: \n~150 years  \n \n"}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
