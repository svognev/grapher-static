WHO's hemoglobin thresholds are then used to determine anemia status based on age, sex, and physiological status.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to meet physiologic needs, which vary by age, sex, altitude, smoking status, and pregnancy status. In its severe form it is associated with fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness. Children under age 5 and pregnant women have the highest risk for anemia.\n"}}}}
