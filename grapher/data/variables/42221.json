Dates for the last outbreaks of smallpox in Australia (1917) and New Zealand (1914) are reported in the text – in both countries smallpox has always been rare. \r\n\r\nThe dates for Madagascar and Namibia are not exactly known – the authors only report that smallpox was eradicated in Madagascar before 1918 and for Namibia before 1955 (so I chose these years for eradication). \r\n\r\nCountries are shown in their current borders – successor countries of Yugoslavia, the USSR and the Sudan are assigned the eradication date of these states: 1925 for Yugoslavia, 1936 for the USSR, and 1972 for the Sudan."}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
