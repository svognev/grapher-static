Enforced disappearance is defined as the arrest, detention, abduction or \nany other form of deprivation of liberty, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty \nor by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person \noutside the protection of the law (International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from \nEnforced Disappearance, adapted to account for disappearances perpetrated by non-State actors). \nArbitrary detention is detention without due process and safeguards, as outlined in Article 9(1) ICCPR. \nTorture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a \nconfession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having \ncommitted, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination \nof any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or \nacquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (Convention against \nTorture). Assault means physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily \ninjury. \n \nHuman rights defenders is a term used to describe people who, individually or with others, act to \npromote or protect human rights. Human rights defenders are identified above all by what they do and it \nis through a description of their actions and of some of the contexts in which they work that the term can \nbest be explained. The definition of human rights defenders may include journalists and trade unionists, \nbut each individual case is counted only once. Other examples may include a student campaigning to end \ntorture in prisons, a politician who takes a stand against endemic corruption or witnesses in court cases \non human rights abuses. \n \n\n\fJournalists cover ‘journalists, media workers and social media producers who generate a significant \namount of public-interest journalism.’ This conceptualisation, has been agreed by UNESCO Member \nStates, and could include a wide range of actors, including professional full-time reporters and analysts, \nforeign correspondents and local journalists, as well as bloggers and other social media producers who \nengage in forms of self-publication in print, on the Internet or elsewhere, journalists from ‘traditional \nmedia’ and those who work across multiple media. \n \nThe term “trade unionist” refers to an individual employed or accredited by a trade union, and other \nelected representatives of workers, including workers in the informal sector. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nEstimates of the number of violations are particularly sensitive to the completeness of reporting of \nindividual events. Such data may underestimate (or sometimes, though more rarely, overestimate) the \ntrue number of cases. In most instances, the number of cases reported will depend on the access to \ninformation, motivation and perseverance of civil society organizations and the media. \n \nWhile this indicator does not cover every aspect of this particular target, it does identify one of the most \nsalient and measurable dimensions that impacts on the whole. Further, it is an indicator that draws upon \nexisting UN agreements and mechanisms for data collection. \n \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nNA \n \nTime series: \nNA \n
