Individuals or small groups usually commit homicide, whereas killing in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly cohesive groups of up to several hundred members and is thus usually excluded."/><link rel="canonical" href="https://static.ourworldindata.org/grapher/intentional-homicides-per-100000-people"/><meta property="fb:app_id" content="1149943818390250"/><meta property="og:url" content="https://static.ourworldindata.org/grapher/intentional-homicides-per-100000-people"/><meta property="og:title" content="Intentional homicides (per 100,000 people)"/><meta property="og:description" content="Intentional homicides are estimates of unlawful homicides purposely inflicted as a result of domestic disputes, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, intergang violence over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups.
